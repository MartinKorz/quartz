Now, how easy is it to add images?
Can I just paste an image to `obsidian` and it works?

- [x] yes. (you can see the "NeutorbrÃ¼cke" in Ulm)

## And what about larger images?

-> They just get inserted in the usual size, and opening them in a new tab shows the full resolution. Thus, for the sake of website size, one should not overdo it with large images, but they definitely work if needed
