$\sin\omega t$

And let us also test longer equations:

$$ \vec{F}(\vec{r})  =  - G \dfrac{mM}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_M|^3}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_M)  $$
- [x] The standard math works well.


```tex
$$ \begin{align} 
\vec{F}(\vec{r}) &= - G \dfrac{mM}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_M|^3}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_M) & \\ 
\vec{r}_M(t)  & \approx  (0,0,0)  & \forall t \\
\vec{r}(0) & = (r_0,0,0) \\
\dot{\vec{r}} &= (0,v_0,0) \\
\end{align}$$
```
weirdly, the above had originally rendered in my browser until I added the third line and now I cannot get `align` to work at all. Well, but that would have been a bit much to ask for as out-of-the-box math-support.
