title: overview for physics
---

I am wondering whether I can replace the folder site by putting an index file in the folder?

Back to [[index|start]] 
- [[physics]]

And the result: Yes, this file does show up in the folder overview - however the overview of the other files remains in there which is actually quite nice.
