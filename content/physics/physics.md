Let me test whether linking between folders works. 
Link to parent folder [[../index|index]]
- [x] works

![[physics 2023-11-11 19.55.05.excalidraw.svg]]

<!-- %% [[physics 2023-11-11 19.55.05.excalidraw.md|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]], and the [[physics 2023-11-11 19.55.05.excalidraw.dark.svg|dark exported image]] %%
-->

So, inserting excalidraw drawings works well (however, I do not know how to make quartz embed the light or dar-themed image depending on the theme of the website â€“ this it will be important to consider both themes while making diagrams)
