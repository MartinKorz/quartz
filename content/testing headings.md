Testing headings will be easy, I can just add

# A first level heading

then continue with a 

## second level heading

and 

### a third level heading

#### a level-4 heading
##### a level-5 heading
and, finally
###### a level-6 heading

A question now becomes whether I can link back to the [[#second level heading]] 
- [x] looks good - however the browser view did not change in my case as the page is small anyway.

At some point I will want to put my custom `css` for all of the details, but this is quite nice already. Thus, let's continue with [[testing images]]
