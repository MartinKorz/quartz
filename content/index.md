In this test blog, I see whether I can use an obsidian vault as the basis for blogging.

## Some tests

A first test site is [[First site - testing the math possibilities]]

And link to a note in subfolder `physics` [[physics/physics|physics]] where I also tested excalidraw-compatibility.

What is left are [[testing headings]] and [[testing images]]
